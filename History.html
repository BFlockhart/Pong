    <div class="hist">
        <p>In the year of 2019 CE, the Cruiser's Beer Pong Championship was born. A group of friends from all walks of life, would find themselves bonded forever with the birth of one of their many traditions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        A member of the group, Sir Goodwin, direct descendant of the last Anglo-Saxon King of England, Harold Godwin, spun up the idea of he and his friends heading away each year, to celebrate the year had, another year of friendship and memories and to kick-off the next year ahead in good spirits. Of course, New Years day (also Sir Flockhart's Birthday) was the perfect time for such an occasion each year.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        At each getaway, it was also conceived that they would congregate to partake in an annual Beer Pong tournament and so, to make things more official, Sir Goodwin commissioned The Holy Shield - a piece of memorabilia which would see individuals names carved into history forever. To create a story to be told to future generations.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The shield does not only make an appearance at the tournament itself - in fact, it is the Champions responsibility to look after the shield for that year and bring it to the next tournament, to defend their title. This allows the Champions bragging rights, and something to showcase their triumph.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        An so, in 2019 the first tournament was played, and thus the annual holy tradition was born.</p>
