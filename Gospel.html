        <p>The following rules are to be enforced by the nominated umpire. Punishments will typically be in the form of a shot being discounted or a cup to be drunk depending on the severity.</p>
        <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Elbows behind the table's edge.</li>
                <li>Trick shots allowed if you regain the ball after taking your shot.</li>
                <li>Trick shots must be respectable (fully sick).</li>
                <li>If both people sink in the same cup then it is splash and thus +2.</li>
                <li>Rethrows if both teammates sink a cup.</li>
                <li>Bouncer is 2 cups, but can be swatted away after the bounce.</li>
                <li>Bouncing off a cup into another cup only counts as 1.</li>
                <li>No interfering with a ball that has been thrown unless it bounces.</li>
                <li>Redemption is to be played after last cup is sunk, unless a team performs Coup de Grace.</li>
                <li>Coupe de Grace is when both teammates sink in the same cup.</li>
                <li>Intentionally pegging the ball to knock off the cup/s is illegal.</li>
                <li>Cups nearing the edge may be moved from the edge by a thumb knuckle.</li>
                <li>Liquid in cups must be to decided regulation.</li>
                <li>Cups must be drunk immediately after they are sunk.</li>
